<h3>We need you</h3>
<p>We need your support. The MuPiBox development is currently stalling a bit, partly due to the complexity and time required, but also due to the missing appreciation from the community.
We always receive new requests for features. On the other hand, there are not so much donations.
If you would like to help, please donate a small amount to nero and splitti. A developer with experience in NodeJS/Angular would also help us.</p>
